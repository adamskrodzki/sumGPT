# ADD GPT

Simple character-level LLM based on [https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt)

Uses autogenerated data in form of examples following format:

[0-9]+\\+[0-9]+=[0-9]+

with all numbers being maximum 9 digits long.
Therefore **context_length=32** and **vocab_size=16** is sufficient.

vocabulary is as follows:
['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '+', '=', '\n', '_', 'X']

where \n is end of generation, X is a character that never occures in training data and so it shouldnt in generation.

_ is padding character

for simplicity of training each example is paded to 32 characters,
